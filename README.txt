This is a messy dataset of pet names, great for exercises on data cleaning!

Dr. Jen Golbeck recruited responses from Twitter in this post on July 21, 2019:

Below are the columns with instructions given to people who completed the form. All fields were short text boxes allowing any answer:

-What kind of pet is this (Dog, Cat, Bird, Other)
-Pet's Full Name - Respondants were instructed as follows: you don't have to include your last name. Think "Winston Churchill" and not "Winston Churchill MYLASTNAME"
-Pet's everyday name (e.g. "Church")
-Pet's age
-Pet's breed (if applicable)

The data is tab separated.

You are welcome to use, share, and edit this data, but please keep the text of this original README with it.

If you use this data for any research, please cite as follows and also let Jen know because she'd be fascinated to read it: @jengolbeck on Twitter or jgolbeck@umd.edu
